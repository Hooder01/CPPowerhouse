/*
Task: Rotate the Sun Around the Lego Brick
Description:
In this task, your goal is to input the correct coordinates to make the sun rotate around a Lego brick, effectively providing it with a light source. This exercise challenges your understanding of coordinate systems, rotations, and light simulation within a virtual environment. Remember to carefully analyze the relationships between the sun, the Lego brick, and their respective positions in space. Good luck!
